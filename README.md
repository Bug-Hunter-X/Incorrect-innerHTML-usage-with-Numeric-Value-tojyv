# Uncommon HTML Error: Incorrect innerHTML Usage

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error related to the usage of the `innerHTML` property in HTML.  Specifically, it highlights the unexpected behavior that can occur when attempting to set `innerHTML` to a numeric value instead of a string.

## Bug Description
The bug occurs when a numeric value is passed directly to the `innerHTML` property of an HTML element. While the browser might attempt to convert this value to a string implicitly, the result might not be consistent or predictable across different browsers. This can lead to unexpected visual results or other problems in web applications.

## Solution
To avoid this issue, always ensure that the value assigned to `innerHTML` is a string.  Explicitly convert numeric or other non-string values to strings before setting them using `innerHTML`.
